# Learning MEAN stack from thinkster.io

The acronym "MEAN" stands for "[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)" and represents a group of technologies which are known to synergize well together. The major benefit of the MEAN stack is that it's extremely quick to prototype with. Node.js allows you to use Javascript on the backend as well as the frontend which can save you from having to learn a separate language. In addition, the NoSQL nature of MongoDB allows you to quickly change and alter the data layer without having to worry about migrations, which is a very valuable attribute when you're trying to build a product without clear specifications. Finally, these technologies have a lot of community support behind them so finding answers to questions or hiring help is going to be much easier using these technologies.
